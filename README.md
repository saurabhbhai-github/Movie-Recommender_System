# 🎬 Movie Recommender System

A **Movie Recommendation System** built using **Unsupervised Machine Learning** techniques.  
This project uses **text vectorization (Bag of words)** and **cosine similarity** to recommend movies based on their descriptions.  
The web interface is developed using **Streamlit**.
